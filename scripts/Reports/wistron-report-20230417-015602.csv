RDS instances exposed to the internet are prone to external security threats. It is highly recommended to restrict network interfaces that are attached to the RDS instance to known hosts or services only.,Prisma_Cloud,high,eni-02a4ef66913fa69ab,aws,362710435132,Wistron-PD-WiWall,AWS Virginia,"The following steps are recommended to restrict traffic from the Internet:
1. Visit the Network path Analysis from Source to Destination and review the network path components that allow internet access.
2. Identify the network component on which restrictive rules can be implemented.
3. Implement the required changes and make sure no other resources have been impacted due to these changes:
 a) The overly permissive Security Group rules can be made more restrictive.
 b) Move the RDS database instance inside a restrictive subnet.
 c) Define a NAT rule to restrict traffic coming from the Internet to the respective RDS database instance.",open,"Sep 16, 2022 13.13 CST Asia/Taipei",,,,,,,eni-02a4ef66913fa69ab
